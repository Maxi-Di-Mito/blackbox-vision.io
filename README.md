#This is the Official Repository for Blackbox Website [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BlackBoxVision/blackbox-vision.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BlackBoxVision/blackbox-vision.io)

The App is built around javascript stack. The entire stack of technologies is the following: 
- NodeJS
- Express
- NodeMailer
- Redux
- ReactJS
- Material Design Lite 
- Other related React/Redux technologies

##Why we select this stack?

Actually I'm working with all this Javascript stuff, and the main version of this website was being built with AngularJS. AngularJS was pretty slow when interacting with the DOM and the load times of the website deployed on localhost where around 3/4 seconds. 

Migrating the version to ReactJS was a good decision, because with the mix of React and Server Side Rendering we get faster load of the page, about 200/350 milliseconds.
